/**
 * PropertyPro - Inline role gate
 *
 * For route handlers written as plain `export async function GET(request)`
 * rather than wrapped in `withRoleAndDB`. Restructuring those into the wrapper
 * form means rewriting the whole function body; this gives them the same
 * guarantees with a two-line guard at the top:
 *
 *   const gate = await requireRole([UserRole.ADMIN, UserRole.MANAGER]);
 *   if ("error" in gate) return gate.error;
 *   const { user } = gate;
 *
 * It resolves custom roles exactly as withRoleAndDB does, so a role created in
 * the admin UI behaves identically on both kinds of route — a plain
 * `session.user.role` comparison would refuse every custom-role holder.
